                <span>It's good for you. It's good for the environment. You'll feel better about yourself. These are just a few of the reasons that may compel someone to purchase an environmentally friendly, or "green" product. Over the past few decades, green products have gradually emerged as a niche in the market, accounting for 4 percent of worldwide market share. Green purchasing is particularly relevant in the EU, where all countries have committed to sustainable consumption. However, while studies have been done on green purchasing behavior in individual countries, it is unclear what the determinants of green purchasing are on a larger scale. What, then, are the primary motives for green consumption across EU countries?</span>

            <p>we believe every effort small or large counts. We want to do as much as we can, as often as we can, to make this world a healthier and happier place. 
                We need an emergency response to climate change that will drive a massive and very fast restructuring of the economy so we can reduce concentrations of Greenhouse gases and cool the planet.
